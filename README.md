# PCS 23-56: Stress Detection and Stress Management using ML
In this project, 
* we have integrated ML and web development
* 
##Technologies used:##
* Machine Learning - for detection
* Python - used as langauge in Machine Learning and Flask
* Flask - framework between ML and web
* HTML,CSS,JavaScript - for frontend

##Workflow:##

frontend (receive input)-> sent to flask app->Stress Classification using Machine Learing model->Flask(output sent)->frontend


After stress detection, stress is management using web features
* Blog pages
* Mediative music
* Yoga exercises
